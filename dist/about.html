        <p>
          I am an IT professional with 3+ years experience in Front End Web Development &amp; Business Analysis. I have worked with a number of modern web technologies from vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript to advanced web frameworks like AngularJS, Node.js, Bootstrap, Materialize and jQuery. I have also had some exposure to React, PHP and .Net development as I like to keep up to date with technologies by taking courses in my spare time.
